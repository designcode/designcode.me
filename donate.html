            <h1>Help Stray Animals</h1>

            <p>
              You're probably here because you saw a guy running Amsterdam
              Marathon with a costume. Good that it caught your eyes as I want
              to bring awareness to the issue of stray animals in Pakistan.
            </p>

            <p>
              I grew up in Pakistan and I can tell you, stray animals have a
              very hard life. They're often abused, neglected, and abandoned.
              Government often run compaigns to euthanize them in a very
              inhumane way.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are a handful non-profit organizations in Pakistan that are
              doing a great job to help stray animals and you can help them by
              donating to them. I am listing them below. Instead of taking my
              word for it, you can check out their instagram profiles and see
              for yourself.
            </p>

                they deal with many animals in need of care.</strong
